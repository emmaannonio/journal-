# What I learned today
- use voyant tools to find things you normally wouldnt see
- things may jump out at you 
- looking up certain words is much more helpful than just usign command f because you see all of the times that word was used in the same place instead of skipping through words and pages 
- After partaking in the word and text analysis, I realized how I could use this tool beofre reading to get an idea of what teh chapter might entail, and waht important words I should take more notice too. 

# Questions
- why upload seperate chapters of Walden into Voyant tools, when the full text in plain text was basically the same thing? Will thsi allow us to compare chapters?
