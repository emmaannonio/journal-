## Quick Review
- Finder : in computer speak its called the *GUI* - Graphical User Interface - puts a layer between you and the actual workings of the computer 
    - shows you file and folders 
- Files and Folders : also called directories; everything is structured heircarchily; easier to grasp if you look at it in columns 
- /Users/yourusername/path/to/some/file    --> every file has a postal system 
- file://Users/yourusername/path/. . . 
- http://somedomain.org/path/to/page    --> paralleled to this ; when you search things on computer, you are just connectign to another computer to fetch the file you are searching 
- everything you look at on your computer is a copy 
- .pdf , .jpg , .docx, .txt, .md, .html --> File extensions/ file format are so important becasue you should know what file you are looking at from the GUI 
    - pdf stands for portable document format 
    - .txt for plain text 
- why do we like plain text? --> can be anything , greater accessability, transformable, lightweight, cross platform 
- what is markdown? its a simplified symbolic formattign for plain text 
- Markup language? language for describing content in a text file, mainly for the purpose of presentation on the web 
- CSS : a language for assigning styling to markup
