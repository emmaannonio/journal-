## Things I learned Today 

<p> I learned how to use HTML !!! It actually worked today and I am very happy!!!! Not sure why teh pnd symbols on this jounral are not blue but I am sure I will figure it out! I firgured it out! I forgot to add the .md onto the name of the file! There are ways to customize and stylize your font and color choices when using html and markdown. 

- command line allows you to talk directly to your computer, everything has to be typed perfectly 
- commands that start with sudo usually will wipe your entire harddrive
- prob should backup your computer and files somewhere 
- create a directory and create a file inside that directory 
- tab key : start typing command and then hit it 
- up and down arrows:Cwill let you go throught the commands
- control  : get out of things going bad 

- getting to cammand line 
    - 
<style>
    body {
        margin:0 20% 0 20%;
    }

    h1 {
        font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans- 
        color: red; 
    }

    p { 
       font-family: sans-
       color: blue
