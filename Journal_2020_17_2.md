## Things I learned Today
- pwd --> where you are right now in terminal 
- ls --> everything in user folder 
- cd --> change directories , type Docu then hit tab and it will complete : will bring you back home 
- mkdir (then name of new file)
- echo command -> see something in standard output 
    - echo $HOME

- Learning to write a shell script 
- use command line to make a new file --> mkdir scripts --> code scripts 
- make new file inside scripts inside VSC name it hello.sh and type the stuff from GitHub
    - #!/bin/bash   --> saying that this is a bash file, I contain instructions that should be followed 
    (#! means shabang)

    - mkdir ~/hello   --> make a directory inside user directory 
    ( ~ is shorthand for the user/ thing)
    - cd ~/hello
    - echo Hello World! > hello_world.txt    --> go into the directory 
    - code hello_world.txt     

- chmod --> making mods  +x hello.sh 



### Markdown 

- Journals due Wed! What are you learning ! 
- Walden! I actually enjoy reading this book and getting an insight into how Thoreau believed life should be lived! I think it is interesting how many of his beliefs can be related to technology today (how poinsonous it is, advancing or yielding us as as a society?)

- windows seem to be superior to macs when writing a shell script - i have had to add many things that windows users already have installed 
- it's easy to get behind in this class esp when the TAs come to help you, you have to shift your focus from Proff to them and you miss even more 
- holy crap! i made a new folder through terminal and it was in my folder! i honestly did not think that was going to work and I am very excited!
- jk it was hard
