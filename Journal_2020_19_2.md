- have to push the journals into github 
- wasnt working at first and then I figured it out 
- all of my journal files are in github --> pretty cool 
- if you edit the journal files in VSC you have to repush the files into git 

- TO EDIT 
    - git add (name of file)
    - git commit -m "notes"
    - git push origin master --> to actually push into git hub
