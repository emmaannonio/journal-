# Coronacoping 
- I have definitely noticed the downside of using technology all day long. Although, it allows me to stay conncted with my friends and family, it has begun to take a toll on my concentration and health. I've noticed I am getting headaches toward the end of the night after being exposed to blue light throughout the day and my back has begun to work from leaning over my laptop completing assignmets. I wonder how, when this is all over, if I will change the way I use technology. 

# Fluid Text 
- After analyzing examples of fluid passages from Walden, I would be interested to search for other examples of works I have read and other texts in the world. Its interesting to see how the author of a certain work chnages words and grammars to construct a totally different meaning. When reading the works of writers who have passed on, this is extremely interestign as it gives us, the reader, an insight into their thought process.
