# First day of distance learning!
- Adjusting to this new period in my life and the semester has proved to be challenging. I never thought that I would be living through a pandemic, or imagined how that would impact me. When we got the news that all SUNY schools will move to online learning that last live class, I was truly shocked becasue Geneseo had not seen any cases of COVOID at all. I honeslty thought the whole situation was being blown out of proportion. After returning to Long Island, I realized how wrong I was and how drastic the situation was in this part of the country. There was no toilet paper to be seen, while 2 days prior I had no problem buying toilet paper in Geneseo where it was fully stocked. People were wearing masks and gloves, something I had not seen in Geneseo. My family is now self-isoalting to protect ourselves from becoming infected. While we are all in good health, we fear for my grandparents. 
- The situation here feels very eery. Things seem normal: People are walkign their dogs, going for runs on the beach, letting their kids play outside. I turn on the news and I see another hundred people have passed away due to the virus and hundreds more are becoming infected. My mom wont let me run to the store to go get something. In the blink of an eye, every person I know world has changed. It is scary to think that a person I migth have passed taking a walk around my block could be carrying the virus. 

# Technology
- With the start of online classes I realize that my reliance on technology is stronger now then it ever was. The transition has been difficult for me; I enjoy learning in person and I learn best with hands-on instruction and collaboration. Learning online truly does feel distanced to me, I am not talking to the people I would normally see everyday in class, I am unable to work on group projects in person, and I am sitting in front of my laptop all day long. 
- Without this technology, I would not be able to continue to recieve an education. Our country is shifting everything online and it is amazing to see the programs that exist to support such a significant and rapid change in the world. My mom, a preschool teacher to 2 year olds, has begun to record herself everyday in 'Dora the Explorer' fashion for her students to learn at home. 
- Connection : Technology is the one thing keeping everyone connected. Without out technological devices, how would we recieve updates about the virus or how Italy is progressing? How would we speak to those hours away? How would we contact our professors when we need help?
- We are so lucky to be living in time where technology is so advanced. I cannot imagine how I would react to this situation if I did not have my laptop or phone to keep me connected.
