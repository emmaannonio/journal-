# Walden 
- Now more then ever, I am intrigued by Walden and Thoreau living alone in his Cabin by the woods. Although, he was never truly in isolation, I find it coincidental hwo we are reading this book while many of us are in voluntary quarnatine. Thoreau's connection with nature is something I am able to relate to on a closer level now. I am able to go for walks around my town, walks on the beach, and do work in my backyard when I need fresh air. I have mroe apprectaion for nature now then I have had before.  
- the impact of technology: For Thoreau, he found pleasure in solitare in scholarly acts such as reading or writing. He clearly had hobbies as he was able to build his home. He found peace in nature and enjoyed observing people in town.
- Right now, I think everyone is living a little bit more like Thoreau during his time living in the cabin. We however, have access to our multiple forms of technology and I would argue that this is how many people are surviving being in quarantine.
- ebooks: With libraries closing, people have been turning to ebooks to read. This of course is one of the many benefits our technology gives us.
