# Looking Back
- In the beginning of the semester I remember beeing confused with this class, thinking to myself "why does it matter how I have my files organized"
- Looking back, I had no folders for any of my files, and my desktop/documents were extremely unorganized. Professor Schacht recommended to us to create an organized system of folders to aid us in the skills and programs we would be using throughout the class. This has made such a difference to how I learn in this class and my other classes. I never realized how such a small change in the way I use my laptop could impact my academic and extracurricular life in so many ways. 
- After helping my brother with an assignment, I got frustrated with how unorganized his laptop is, and asked him to organize it more efficently like mine to which we replied "no." Well, at least I tried. 

# CoronaCoping 
- After one overwhelming week of distance learning, I think I have finally adapted to "online school" and have created a nice schedule for how my week plays out. I have been waking up much earlier than I was In Geneseo and I have learned that I like to get my work done early to free up space later in the day. In school, it seemed as though I was exhausting myself with everything I did outside of class, that waking up early wasnt a possibilty. 
- Like Thoreau, I think I am learning a lot about myself in "solitude." I feel a stronger urge to go ouside and be with nature, and I often long to have the practical skills he had during his time in the cabin. I wonder if Thoreau ever felt the urge to simply move back to 'town' and leave his life in the woods. 

# FLuid Text 
-  to any literary work that exists in multiple versions
- author's drafts, publishers' proofs, revised editions of books, adaptations for film
- interactions between the author and society - how will society react to your piece/text? How will I revise it from there?
