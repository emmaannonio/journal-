# CoronaCoping 
- We are about to go onto week 7 of online learning. . .time surely flies, but I am not sure I can say I have been having fun. I have never taken an online class, and I am not sure I will after this. I have always prefered hands-on learning and beign away from that has shown me how challenging online courses can be. I have also missed the interactions I used ot have with my classmates everyday. Some of these people, I would only communicate with inside a certain class, and I have truly missed these face to face connections. 
- Something Random: I spend a lot of time scrolling through social media ( I wish I didnt!!!!!!) and usually see a funny meme that resurfaces every April 30th, and to my shock, I did not see it at all this year. * I will try to insert the meme below *

# Final Proj
- I have finally tackled the Walden Manuscript Pages today. . . and I have to say, they were not as scary as I once believed they were. It may have taken a couple of hours, but I was able to locate the beginning of several chapters, while also practicing reading and familiarizing myself with his handwriting. 
- It has been a bit difficut communicating with everyone in my group, but I am hopign that this week we will all bunker down and get the project on its way to completion!
