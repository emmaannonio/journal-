# CoronaCoping
- It's hard to believe that it is already May and that we have been distanced learning for the past 6 weeks. While, college classes end in two weeks, mid May, all other teachers in New York state will continue their online teaching for another 7 weeks. As an education major, it is hard to imagine how one would teach young students across a screen, sometimes not even live. At home, I frequently babysit for several families in my time, and when I am not doing school work, I try to facetime the kids as often as possible. I have learned that online learning for them is just as frustating and as "not fun" as it is for us. 

# Final Proj 
- I reccomended the chapter "Sounds" from Walden, for my final project group to focus on. I enjoy the way Thoreau portrays different sounds throughout this chapter and what these different sounds represent. Since being home, I have noticed new sounds that signal different times thoughout the day. One in particular that I would like to write about in the blog post section, is the clapping for essential workers that happens right at 7 pm every night. This is the one time when we all come out of solitude and salte those fighting on the front lines. 
- I am definitely feeling the most nervous about the TEI file we need to create for the final project. It is something I struggled with and I am hoping my group members can supplement by weakness with their strengths. It is also nice to have friends in other groups I can reach out to if I need help.
