# Connection 
- I have been video chatting my final project group very frequently and it is something I always look forward to. Going into this project, I was nervous, at I had not know the people in my group very well at all, some I couldnt even put a name to a face. Now, I am eager to video chat them and not only discuss our project, but discuss our otehr classes and thigns going on in our own lives, #coronacoping. Communication and Connection are both strong forces and are vital to the human experience. Now more then ever there is a desire to stay connected, and to do that theri needs to be effective communication. Luckly for us, we are way past the age of the telegraph, and can easily zoom eachother in the matter of seconds. 

# Final Project
- We have finally been able to logically divide up the work for the timeline. We have changed our focus an decided to focus on several passages in Economy, Where I Lived, and Sounds as we have found several revisons in these passages that will be intersting to disect and analyze. 
- We have also chosen a passage for the TEI file and have started to create sections for each member in the group to work on.
